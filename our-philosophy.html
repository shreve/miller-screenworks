<p>It&#39;s about as simple as it gets!  We donâ€™t believe in charging the customer set-up fees, minimum runs, artwork time or other hidden charges.</p>

<p>We believe the process of designing and printing quality garments should be simple and affordable to all of our customers.  Good customer service dictates that we promote the ability of the customer to order the quantity they desire, no minimum order.  We also provide design services at no cost.  We want your project to look the best, so we work with you on your design until it is just right.  </p>

<p>Under our roof, we plan on you coming back for additional orders.  We produce screens with permanent images capable of printing thousands of garments.  After your print run is completed, we inventory your permanent screen for you.  When you call for repeat orders, we just pull your screen out of inventory and continue printing.  No additional charges, no hidden fees.  </p>

<p>At Miller Screenworks, we believe in doing things that make sense for the customer.  That is why we only charge a ONE-TIME fee of $20.00 to manufacture the permanent screen for you. </p>

<h2>Inks, Inks, and More Inks.</h2>

<p>Most garment printers use inks containing plastics. Those plastic inks work great for the printer but not so well for the customer or the environment. </p>

<p>At Miller Screenworks, we take a different approach.  Our inks are all environmentally friendly, certified non-toxic and 100% allergen free.  These next generation inks penetrate the individual fibers of the fabric ensuring that the image will last as long as the garment.  No more peeling or cracking inks. These inks leave the printed image very soft and smooth and the fabric free to breathe.  As no solvents are used in any part of our process, all of our printed garments can be worn right out of the box.  No worries about allergens.</p>
