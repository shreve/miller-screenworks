We take every measure to make sure your information is secure. This page details some of how we protect your privacy.</p>

<h2>Secure Technology</h2>

<p>Every page you visit on millerscreenworks.com requires HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which uses high-grade encryption technology to protect your sensitive data as you send it to us. That also applies to data we send back to your computer.</p>

<p>The company that processes your credit card when you make a purchase, <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">Stripe</a>, also stores your credit card data. They&#39;re certified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-compliant</a> to the most strict level possible, so they&#39;re the people we trust most to keep your card safe. We never actually see your credit card information, just a temporary token generated by Stripe that looks like this: <code>tok_15rDy32eZvKYlo2C5ctWwpyb</code>. We don&#39;t save this token, and even if we did, there&#39;s no way it can be used to steal your card.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Sorry, not the delicious kind.
We use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">HTTP Cookies</a> to identify users on our site.
Basically, cookies are small bits of data that our server and your browser send back and forth with your page requests so we can keep track of who&#39;s doing what.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible for you to disable cookies in your browser, but without them, you cannot login to our site, keep items in your cart, or checkout.
You&#39;ll only be able to browse our products and pages.</p>

<p>Have no fear! We don&#39;t use cookies to track your behavior on other sites or anything creepy like that.
We only use them to identify you as you visit pages throughout our site.
Your cookies are protected by HTTPS, so no one can steal them as they travel from your computer to our server.
They&#39;re also encrypted on your computer so no one can mess with their cookies and pretend to be you.</p>

<p>Your browser sends some text to us that looks like this:
<code class="code--block">Set-Cookie: VytNUmJWWDVaVlgvYVA2K3JnQ3lVZXdGdVk2NkNXTUFyRThPaGtPQ1BSRXV3K1RiTTNxOEx5R0lsZE1UY1BMVjY4N1VCV3F1dG4zaDhlcEVXVmxhZEVjb3VRYk85Wmc2b0dWUEhYcTdXWDlTZkJ0MmpjVVhKYXVqTW9COUdFazhNaWYzMHUrcDJYMGROQkVnbTUyTWdPYmZPY2JNWlhYcnVMRFNiTmhEZkR3aE1YVktxVkFOMmpydkRCaUU1VDNyc1QyalJiTlo4WXlHTlJLUExCZVYyMWtZMEJpT1BLT0I1N1Jjenc1ZDdTM3ZOZ3R4aVJJYjI1Ym1tMlVaaHplMkpRbExkRWtuQjhnOWRZclF5ZWJnR3lYWEdoTFZpREJHNVJiN0R1bWQyVFE9LS1BZmZ6b2JkdmRzVGNkVzY4ejRocnNnPT0=--aff945b5badaead773374f6f3c2d3694f2d20aab</code>
We recieve it, decrypt it, then use the data to figure out who sent it.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>

<p><em>We will never sell or give away your information</em>. The only third party that will have any of your information is our credit card processor, Stripe. The only other third party that has a chance of getting your information is law enforcement. However unlikely they may be, we <em>will</em> cooperate with police investigations, provided a warrant for your information.</p>

<h2>CAN-SPAM Act <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Email</h2>

<p>We do not engage in marketing and promotional emails.</p>

<p>All emails received from the site (<a href="mailto:bot@millerscreenworks.com">bot@millerscreenworks.com</a>) will be transactional emails, meaning they were directly caused by your interaction with the site. Due to the nature of these emails, there will be no option to unsubscribe or opt-out within the email. These will mostly be receipts.</p>

<h2>Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p>In accordance with the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506), we do not knowingly collect information of persons in United States jurisdiction under the age of 13. All collected personal information is for the purpose of completing transactions. The “Online Purchasing Terms” section of our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> requires that any customer completing a transaction through the site must be at least 13 years old.</p>
